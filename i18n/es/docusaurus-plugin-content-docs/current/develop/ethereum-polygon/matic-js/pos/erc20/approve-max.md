`approveMax` method can be used to approve max amount on the root token.

```
const erc20RootToken = posClient.erc20(<root token address>, true);

const approveResult = await erc20RootToken.approveMax();

const txHash = await approveResult.getTransactionHash();

const txReceipt = await approveResult.getReceipt();

```

## spenderAddress

The address on which approval is given is called `spenderAddress`. It is a third-party user or a smart contract which can transfer your token on your behalf.

By default spenderAddress value is erc20 predicate address.

You can specify spender address value manually.

```
const erc20RootToken = posClient.erc20(<root token address>,true);

// approve 100 amount
const approveResult = await erc20Token.approveMax({
    spenderAddress: <spender address value>
});

const txHash = await approveResult.getTransactionHash();

const txReceipt = await approveResult.getReceipt();

```
