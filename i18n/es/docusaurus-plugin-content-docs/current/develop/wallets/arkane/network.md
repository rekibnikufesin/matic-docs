> More detail about environments and networks

Depending on which Arkane environment you or your application connect, your blockchain transactions will be directed to a specific blockchain network. Connect to the Arkane production environment and you will be contacting to the Polygon Mainnet, connect to the Arkane staging environment and you will be connected to the Polygon testnet (Mumbai).

Below you find an overview of the public Arkane environments and to which network they are connecting.

**Note:** If you are a developer it is possible to use different networks or even your own infrastructure, for more information we refere you to [the Arkane documentation](https://arkane.gitbook.io/widget/).
