The mechanism to natively read Ethereum data from Polygon EVM chain is that of ‘State Sync’. In other words, this mechanism enables transfer of arbitrary data from Ethereum chain to Polygon chain. The procedure that makes it possible is: Validators on the Heimdall layer are listening for a particular event — `StateSynced` from a Sender contract, as soon as the event is picked, the `data` that was passed in the event is written on the Receiver contract. Read more [here](/docs/maintain/validator/core-components/state-sync-mechanism).

The Sender and Receiver contract are required to be mapped on Ethereum — [StateSender.sol](https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts/blob/release-betaV2/contracts/root/stateSyncer/StateSender.sol) needs to be aware of each sender and receiver. If you'd like to get the mapping done, please request a mapping [here](https://mapper.polygon.technology/).

In the following walkthrough, we'll be deploying a Sender contract on Goerli (Ethereum testnet) and a Receiver contract on Mumbai (Polygon's testnet) and then we'll be sending data from Sender and reading data on Receiver via web3 calls in a node script.

### 1. Deploy Sender contract

The sole purpose of Sender contract is to be able to call [syncState](https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts/blob/e999579e9dc898ab6e66ddcb49ee84c2543a9658/contracts/root/stateSyncer/StateSender.sol#L33) function on the StateSender contract — which is Matic's state syncer contract - the StateSynced event of which Heimdall is listening to.

Deployed at:

`0xEAa852323826C71cd7920C3b4c007184234c3945` on Goerli

`0x28e4F3a7f651294B9564800b2D01f35189A5bFbE` on Ethereum Mainnet

To be able to call this function, let's first include it's interface in our contract:

```jsx
// Sender.sol

pragma solidity ^0.5.11;

contract IStateSender {
  function syncState(address receiver, bytes calldata data) external;
  function register(address sender, address receiver) public;
}

...
```

Next, let's write our custom function that takes in the data we'd like to pass on to Polygon and calls syncState

```jsx
function sendState(bytes calldata data) external {
    states = states + 1 ;
    IStateSender(stateSenderContract).syncState(receiver, data);
}
```

In the above function, `stateSenderContract` is the address of the StateSender on the network you'll be deploying `Sender` on. (eg., we'll be using `0xEAa852323826C71cd7920C3b4c007184234c3945` for Goerli), and `receiver` is the contract that will receive the data we send from here.

It is recommended to use constructors to pass in variables, but for the purpose of this demo, we'll simply hardcode these two addresses:

Following is how our Sender.sol looks like:

```jsx
// sender.sol

pragma solidity ^0.5.11;

contract IStateSender {
  function syncState(address receiver, bytes calldata data) external;
  function register(address sender, address receiver) public;
}

contract sender {
  address public stateSenderContract = 0xEAa852323826C71cd7920C3b4c007184234c3945;
  address public receiver = 0x83bB46B64b311c89bEF813A534291e155459579e;

  uint public states = 0;

  function sendState(bytes calldata data) external {
    states = states + 1 ;
    IStateSender(stateSenderContract).syncState(receiver, data);
  }

}
```

We're using a simple `states` counter to keep track of the number of states sent via the Sender contract.

Use Remix to deploy the contract and keep a note of the address and ABI.

### 2. Deploy Receiver contract

Receiver contract is the one that is invoked by a Validator when the `StateSynced` event is emitted. The Validator invokes the function `onStateReceive`on the receiver contract to submit the data. To implement it, we first import [StateReceiver](https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts/blob/release-betaV2/contracts/child/bor/StateReceiver.sol) interface and write down our custom logic — to interpret the tranferred data inside onStateReceive.

Following is how our Receiver.sol looks like:

```jsx
// receiver.sol

pragma solidity ^0.5.11;

// IStateReceiver represents interface to receive state
interface IStateReceiver {
  function onStateReceive(uint256 stateId, bytes calldata data) external;
}

contract receiver {

  uint public lastStateId;
  bytes public lastChildData;

  function onStateReceive(uint256 stateId, bytes calldata data) external {
    lastStateId = stateId;
    lastChildData = data;
    }

}
```

The function simply assigns the last received State Id and data to variables. [StateId](https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts/blob/239a91045622ddcf9ebec2cec81fdc6daa3a33e3/contracts/root/stateSyncer/StateSender.sol#L36) is a simple unique reference to the transferred state (a simple counter).

Deploy  your Receiver.sol on Polygon's testnet and keep a note of the address and ABI

### 3. Getting your Sender and Receiver mapped

You can either use the already deployed addresses (mentioned above) for sender and receiver, or deploy your custom contracts and request a mapping done here: [https://mapper.polygon.technology/](https://mapper.polygon.technology/)

### 4. Sending and Receiving data

Now that we have our contracts in place and mapping done, we'll be writing a simple node script to send arbitrary hex bytes, receive them on Polygon and interpret the data!

**4.1 Setup your script**

We'll first initialise our web3 objects, wallet to make the transactions and contracts

```jsx
// test.js

const Web3 = require('web3')
const Network = require("@maticnetwork/meta/network")

const network = new Network ('testnet', 'mumbai')

const main = new Web3(network.Main.RPC)
const matic = new Web3 (network.Matic.RPC)

let privateKey = `0x...` // add or import your private key

matic.eth.accounts.wallet.add(privateKey)
main.eth.accounts.wallet.add(privateKey)

let receiverAddress = `<RECEIVER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>`
let receiverABI = `` // insert or import ABI
let senderAddress = `<SENDER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>`
let senderABI = `` // insert of import the ABI

let sender = new main.eth.Contract(JSON.parse(senderABI), senderAddress)
let receiver = new matic.eth.Contract(JSON.parse(receiverABI), receiverAddress)

```

We're using @maticnetwork/meta package for the RPCs, the package isn't a requirement to run the script.

`matic` and `main` objects refer to the web3 object initialised with Polygon's and Ropsten's RPC respectively.

`sender` and `receiver` objects refer to the contract objects of Sender.sol and Receiver.sol that we deployed in Step 1 and 2.

**4.2 Sending data**

Next, let's setup our functions to create bytestring of the data and send it via Sender contract:

```jsx
// data to sync
function getData(string) {
  let data = matic.utils.asciiToHex(string);
  return data
}

// send data via sender
async function sendData (data) {
  let r = await sender.methods
    .sendState (getData(data))
    .send({
      from: main.eth.accounts.wallet[0].address,
      gas: 8000000
    })
  console.log('sent data from root, ', r.transactionHash)
}
```

Calling `getData` will convert an ascii string (eg., `Hello World !`) to a string of bytes (eg., `0x48656c6c6f20576f726c642021`); while the function `sendData`takes in `data` (an ascii string), calls `getData` and passes on the bytestring to sender contract

**4.3 Receiving data**

Next, we'll be checking for received data on Receiver.sol.

It should take ~7-8 minutes for the state sync to execute.

Add the following functions to check (a) number of sent states from Sender and (b) Last received state on Receiver.

```jsx
// check `states` variable on sender
async function checkSender () {
  let r = await sender.methods
    .states()
    .call()
  console.log('number of states sent from sender: ', r)
}

// check last received data on receiver
async function checkReceiver () {
  let r = await receiver.methods
    .lastStateId()
    .call()
  let s = await receiver.methods
    .lastChildData()
    .call()
  console.log('last state id: ', r, 'and last data: ', s)
  console.log('interpreted data: ', getString(s))
}
```

the function `checkReceiver` simply calls the variables we defined in the contract — which would be set as soon as the Validator calls `onStateReceive` on the contract. The `getString` function simply interprets the bytestring (converts it back to ascii)

```jsx
function getString(data) {
  let string = matic.utils.hexToAscii(data);
  return string
}
```

Finally, we'll write up a method to execute our functions:

```jsx
async function test() {
    await sendData ('Sending a state sync! :) ')
    await checkSender ()
    await checkReceiver ()
}
```

**4.4 Putting it all together!**

This is how our test script looks like:

```jsx
// test.js

const Web3 = require('web3')
const Network = require("@maticnetwork/meta/network")

const network = new Network ('testnet', 'mumbai')

const main = new Web3(network.Main.RPC)
const matic = new Web3 (network.Matic.RPC)

let privateKey = `0x...`
matic.eth.accounts.wallet.add(privateKey)
main.eth.accounts.wallet.add(privateKey)

let receiverAddress = `<RECEIVER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>`
let receiverABI = ``
let senderAddress = `<SENDER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>`
let senderABI = ``

let sender = new main.eth.Contract(JSON.parse(senderABI), senderAddress)
let receiver = new matic.eth.Contract(JSON.parse(receiverABI), receiverAddress)

// data to sync
function getData(string) {
  let data = matic.utils.asciiToHex(string);
  return data
}

function getString(data) {
  let string = matic.utils.hexToAscii(data);
  return string
}

// console.log(getData('Sending a state sync! :) '))

async function sendData (data) {
  let r = await sender.methods
    .sendState (getData(data))
    .send({
      from: main.eth.accounts.wallet[0].address,
      gas: 8000000
    })
  console.log('sent data from root, ', r.transactionHash)
}

async function checkSender () {
  let r = await sender.methods
    .states()
    .call()
  console.log('number of states sent from sender: ', r)
}

async function checkReceiver () {
  let r = await receiver.methods
    .lastStateId()
    .call()
  let s = await receiver.methods
    .lastChildData()
    .call()
  console.log('last state id: ', r, 'and last data: ', s)
  console.log('interpreted data: ', getString(s))
}

async function test() {
    await sendData ('Hello World !')
    await checkSender ()
    // add a timeout here to allow time gap for the state to sync
    await checkReceiver ()
}

test()
```

**4.5 Let's run the script**

Successful execution of the above script provide an output as:

```bash
$ node test
> sent data from root 0x4f64ae4ab4d2b2d2dc82cdd9ddae73af026e5a9c46c086b13bd75e38009e5204
number of states sent from sender: 1
last state id: 453 and last data: 0x48656c6c6f20576f726c642021
interpreted data: Hello World ! 
```
