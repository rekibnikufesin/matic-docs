Polygon is a blockchain application platform that provides hybrid Proof-of-Stake and Plasma-enabled sidechains.

Polygon has a three-layer architecture:

1. Staking and Plasma smart contracts on Ethereum
2. Heimdall (Proof of Stake layer)
3. Bor (Block producer layer)

The below image will help you understand how the core components interact with each other.
