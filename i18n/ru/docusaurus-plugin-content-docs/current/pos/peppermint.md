Peppermint is modified Tendermint. It is changed to use to make it compatible with Ethereum addresses and verifiable on Ethereum chain.

**Overview**

1. Changes to signature scheme
2. Changes to `vote` to make it verifiable on Ethereum smart contract
3. Changes to `vote` encoding scheme

Peppermint uses `secp256k1` signature scheme to verify Tendermint votes on solidity smart contract. [https://github.com/maticnetwork/tendermint/blob/peppermint/crypto/secp256k1/secp256k1_nocgo.go](https://github.com/maticnetwork/tendermint/blob/peppermint/crypto/secp256k1/secp256k1_nocgo.go)

It adds `Data` field into `Vote` and `Proposal` struct to get `hash` for transactions in the block. On smart contract, it checks if `Data` matches with checkpoint data hash and majority (â…”+1) of validator signatures. The idea is to verify if majority of the validator set agrees on transaction in the contract.

Peppermint uses RLP to get `Vote` bytes instead of Amino encoding. Here `Data` is `Txs.Hash()` for the block.  [https://github.com/maticnetwork/tendermint/blob/peppermint/types/canonical.go](https://github.com/maticnetwork/tendermint/blob/peppermint/types/canonical.go)
```go
// [peppermint] create RLP vote to decode in contract
type CanonicalRLPVote struct {
    ChainID string
    Type    byte
    Height  uint
    Round   uint
    Data    []byte
}
```
And using RLP encoding lib to get byte data for signature on Vote.

 [https://github.com/maticnetwork/tendermint/blob/peppermint/types/vote.go#L75-L82](https://github.com/maticnetwork/tendermint/blob/peppermint/types/vote.go#L75-L82)
```go
func (vote *Vote) SignBytes(chainID string) []byte {
    // [peppermint] converted from amino to rlp
    bz, err := rlp.EncodeToBytes(CanonicalizeVote(chainID, vote))
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    return bz
}
```
