Avail is a blockchain that is laser-focused on data availability: ordering and recording blockchain transactions, and making it possible to prove that block data is available without downloading the whole block. This allows it to scale in ways that monolithic blockchains cannot.

:::note A Robust General-Purpose Scalable Data Availability Layer

* Enables Layer-2 solutions to offer increased scalability throughput by leveraging Avail to build Validiums with off-chain data availability.

* Enables standalone chains or sidechains with arbitrary execution environments to bootstrap validator security without needing to create and manage their own validator set by guaranteeing transaction data availability.

### What is the data availability problem?

Peers in a blockchain network need a way to ensure that all the data of a newly proposed block is 
readily available. If the data is not available, the block might contain malicious transactions 
which are being hidden by the block producer. Even if the block contains non-malicious transactions, 
hiding them might compromise the security of the system.

### Avail's approach to data availability

#### High Guarantee

Avail provides a provable, high-level of guarantee that data is
available. Light clients can independendly verify availability in a
constant number of queries, without downloading the entire block.

#### Minimum Trust

No need to be a validator or host a full node. Even with a light
client, get verifiable availability.

#### Easy to Use

Built using modified Substrate, the solution focuses on ease of use, whether you host an application or
operate an off-chain scaling solution.

#### Perfect for Off-Chain Scaling

Unlock the full scaling potential of your off-chain scaling solution by keeping the data with us and
still avoiding the DA problem on L1.

#### Execution Agnostic

Chains that use Avail can implement any type of execution environment
irrespective of the application logic. Transactions from any
environment are supported: EVM, Wasm, or even new VMs that have not
been built yet. Avail is perfect for experimenting with new execution
layers.

#### Bootstrapping Security

Avail enables new chains to be created without needing to spin up a
new validator set, and leverage Avail's instead. Avail takes care of
transaction sequencing, consensus, and availability in exchange for
simple transaction fees (gas).

#### Fast provable finality using NPoS

Fast provable finality via Nominated Proof of Stake. Backed by KZG
commitments and erasure coding.

Start by checking out this [blog post](https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-research-ethereum-scaling-with-rollups-8a2c221bf644/) on scaling
Ethereum with Rollups.

## Avail-Powered Validiums

Due to the architecture of monolithic blockchains 
(such as Ethereum in its current state), operating the blockchain is 
expensive, resulting in high transaction fees. Rollups attempt to extract 
the burden of execution by running transactions off-chain and then posting
the execution results and the [usually compressed] transaction data.

Validiums are the next step: instead of posting the transaction data,
it is kept available off-chain, where a proof/attestation is only
posted to the base layer. This is by far the most cost-effective solution 
because both execution and data availability are kept off-chain while still
allowing for final verification and settlement on the layer 1 chain.

Avail is a blockchain optimized for data availability. Any rollup that
wishes to become a validium can switch to post transaction data to
Avail instead of the layer 1 and deploy a verification contract that, in
addition to verifying the correct execution, also verifies data
availability.

:::note Attestation

The Avail team will make this data availability verification simple on
Ethereum by building an attestation bridge to post data availability
attestations directly to Ethereum. This will make the verification
contract's job a simple one, since the DA attestations will already be
on-chain. This bridge is currently in design; please reach out to the
Avail team for more information or to join our early access program.
