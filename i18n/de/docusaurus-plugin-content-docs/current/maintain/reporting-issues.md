## Where to report a bug

For any bugs or attacks that are discovered, you need to report them to the [Immunefi bug bountry program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/polygon/). **Performing an attack and not providing submission of your proof will result in disqualification of your attempt.**

You need to make sure that you add all relevant details, such as an email address and Discord ID in order to maintain a rapport of communication in case it is required. You also need to provide as many details as possible so that the Polygon team can appropriately evaluate your submission.

## What happens after submitting a report

Upon reporting an issue, the Polygon Project team will review and update/comment on the status of the issue. Upon evaluation, the Polygon team will report the outcome of the submission. The Severity will also be tagged as per the evaluation.
