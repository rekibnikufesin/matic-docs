> Always helping a developer in need

What makes Arkane stand out is their commitment to supporting their ecosystem. Not only their wallet users, by explaining what gas is, or by helping them import an Ethereum wallet into Polygon. But also the developers that are using Arkane to build new upcoming producs, even in their test environment they add an in-app chat so developers can directly communicate with the developer team behind the Arkane platform.

And ofcourse they offer [detailed product documentation](https://arkane.gitbook.io/widget/).
