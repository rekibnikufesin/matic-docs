## Introduction

Developers building on Polygon can now leverage Band's decentralized oracle infrastructure. With Band's oracle, they now have access to various cryptocurrency price data to integrate into their applications.

## Supported Tokens

Currently, the list of supported symbols can be found at [data.bandprotocol.com](http://data.bandprotcool.com). Going forward, this list will continue to expand based on developer needs and community feedback.

### Price Pairs

The following methods can work with any combination of base/quote token pair, as long as the base and quote symbols are supported by the dataset.

## Querying Prices

Currently, there are two methods for developers to query prices from Band's oracle: through Band's `StdReference` smart contract on Polygon and through their [`bandchain.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40bandprotocol%2Fbandchain.js) JavaScript helper library.

### Solidity Smart Contract

To query prices from Band's oracle, a smart contract should reference Band's StdReference contract, specifically the `getReferenceData` and `getReferenceDatabulk` methods.

`getReferenceData` takes two strings as the inputs, the base and quote symbol, respectively. It then queries the `StdReference` contract for the latest rates for those two tokens, and returns a `ReferenceData` struct, shown below.

```solidity
struct ReferenceData {
    uint256 rate; // base/quote exchange rate, multiplied by 1e18.
    uint256 lastUpdatedBase; // UNIX epoch of the last time when base price gets updated.
    uint256 lastUpdatedQuote; // UNIX epoch of the last time when quote price gets updated.
}
```

`getReferenceDataBulk` instead takes two lists, one of the `base` tokens, and one of the `quotes`. It then proceeds to similarly queries the price for each base/quote pair at each index, and returns an array of `ReferenceData` structs.

For example, if we call `getReferenceDataBulk` with `['BTC','BTC','ETH']` and `['USD','ETH','BNB']`, the returned `ReferenceData` array will contain information regarding the pairs:

- `BTC/USD`
- `BTC/ETH`
- `ETH/BNB`


#### Contract Addresses

| Blockchain     |               Contract Address               |
| -------------- |:--------------------------------------------:|
| Polygon (Test) | `0x56e2898e0ceff0d1222827759b56b28ad812f92f` |


#### Example Usage

This [contract](https://gist.github.com/tansawit/a66d460d4e896aa94a0790df299251db) demonstrates an example of using Band's `StdReference` contract and the `getReferenceData` function.


### BandChain.JS

Band's node helper library [`bandchain.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bandprotocol/bandchain.js) also supports a similar `getReferenceData` function. This function takes one argument, a list of token pairs to query the result of. It then returns a list of corresponding rate values.


#### Example Usage

The code below shows an example usage of the function

```javascript=
const { Client } = require('@bandprotocol/bandchain.js');

// BandChain's REST Endpoint
const endpoint = 'https://rpc.bandchain.org';
const client = new Client(endpoint);

// This example demonstrates how to query price data from
// Band's standard dataset
async function exampleGetReferenceData() {
  const rate = await client.getReferenceData(['BTC/ETH','BAND/EUR']);
  return rate;
}

(async () => {
  console.log(await exampleGetReferenceData());
})();

```

The corresponding result will then be similar to

```bash
$ node index.js
[ 
    { 
        pair: 'BTC/ETH',
        rate: 30.998744363906173,
        updatedAt: { base: 1615866954, quote: 1615866954 },
        requestID: { base: 2206590, quote: 2206590 } 
    },
    { 
        pair: 'BAND/EUR',
        rate: 10.566138918332376,
        updatedAt: { base: 1615866845, quote: 1615866911 },
        requestID: { base: 2206539, quote: 2206572 } 
    }
]
```

For each pair, the following information will be returned:

- `pair`: The base/quote symbol pair string
- `rate`: The resulting rate of the given pair
- `updated`: The timestamp at which the base and quote symbols was last updated on BandChain. For `USD`, this will be the current timestamp
- `rawRate`: This object consists of two parts.
  - `value` is the `BigInt` value of the actual rate, multiplied by `10^decimals`
  - `decimals` is then the exponent by which `rate` was multiplied by to get `rawRate`
